======================HOW TO APPLY RIA ON HADOOP EXAMPLE APPLICATIONS============

This example applies RIA into Hadoop 1.0.2 example applications, hadoop-examples-1.0.2.jar

To run this example,
1. Open the protects LoggerLibrary, LogInserterFullJTP and IntegrityChecker with Eclipse Standard with the Kepler Version. Make sure class files are builted under the bin folder of each project.
2. Set up the environment path in the transform_example.sh and the check_example.sh, including WORK_SPACE (the current example directory), JAVA_HOME (ensure the jre/lib/rt.jar and jre/lib/jce.jar can be found under $JAVA_HOME), and the address of the Hadoop server and the log collection server.
3. Run transform_example.sh to generate the PWL (program with log) of hadoop example applications, taggedExample.jar. It will be transmitted to the master host of the hadoop server automatically.
4. On the hadoop server, run the transformed applications, including Wordcount, Pi, Terasort. Use the collect_cluster_tracelog.sh to collect logs from hadoop clusters. 
5. Under the example directory, run the check_example.sh to check the integrity of the execution. It will automatically collect the logs from the hadoop server and check the integrity based on the log.
