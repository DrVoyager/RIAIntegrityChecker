# About RIA Integrity Checker

RIA Integrity Checker is a Java-based tool that facilitates the integrity check of remote execution. It consists of two parts:

1. Log Inserter: It inserts logging statements to the program so that when the program is executed remotely, it will generate logs on the remote environment.

2. Integrity Checker: After downloading the logs to the trusted environment, it will check the consistency between the program and the logs. Any inconsistency indicates a tampering of the remote computing. The Integrity Check differs from existing solution in that

    * Integrity Check will extract the runtime mathemacial constraints among variables in the program and use it as a baseline to check against the integrity of the logs, which is called *audition*.
    * The audition is performed on a function execution basis, i.e., even though a function will call another function, forming as an embedding sequence, Integrity Checker can perform the audition of function executions in a serialized manner. As a result, auditions on the function execution can be performed in a random manner, thus providing users a trade-off between integrity confidence and overhead.

### To show users how to use RIA, we provide several (hadoop) example applications, which showcases how easy to use RIA. 

# HOW TO APPLY RIA ON HADOOP EXAMPLE APPLICATIONS

##Environments & Prerequisites
* This example applies RIA into Hadoop 1.0.2 example applications, so we need 

>* a hadoop cluster
* Hadoop 1.0.2 & hadoop-examples-1.0.2.jar
* java 1.8
* ant 1.9.3

* Set up the environment path 

>In the transform_example.sh and the check_example.sh, set the path, including WORK_SPACE (the current example directory), JAVA_HOME (ensure the jre/lib/rt.jar and jre/lib/jce.jar can be found under $JAVA_HOME), and the address of the Hadoop server and the log collection server.

##Run this example
* Under the example directory

>Run transform_example.sh to transform the example source and pack it into taggedExamples.jar then upload to the hadoop server. 

* On the hadoop server

>Run the transformed applications, including Wordcount, Pi, Terasort use the run_examples.sh
Use the collect_cluster_tracelog.sh to collect logs from hadoop clusters.

* Under the example directory

>Run the check_example.sh to check the integrity of the execution. It will automatically collect the logs from the hadoop server and check the integrity based on the log.
